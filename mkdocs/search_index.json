Automatically Registering Commands  To make the console commands available automatically with BackBee, create a Command  directory inside your bundle and create a PHP file suffixed with Command.php  for each command that you want to provide. For example, if you\nwant to extend the DemoBundle to welcome you from the command line, create WelcomeCommand.php  and add the following to it:  // bundle/WelcomeBundle/Command/WelcomeCommand.php\nnamespace WelcomeBundle\\Command;\n\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputArgument;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputOption;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Output\\OutputInterface;\n\n\nuse BackBee\\Console\\AbstractCommand;\n\nclass WelcomeCommand extends AbstractCommand\n{\n    protected function configure()\n    {\n        $this\n            - setName('demo:welcome')\n            - setDescription('Welcome someone')\n            - addArgument(\n                'name',\n                InputArgument::OPTIONAL,\n                'Who do you want to welcome?'\n            )\n            - addOption(\n                'yell',\n                null,\n                InputOption::VALUE_NONE,\n                'If set, the message will yell in uppercase letters'\n            )\n            - setHelp( EOF\nThe  info %command.name% /info  command can welcome someone.\nWith the option ``yell``, the message will be displayed in uppercase letters.\nEOF;\n            )\n        ;\n    }\n\n    protected function execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output)\n    { \n        $text = 'Welcome '.$input- getArgument('name');\n\n        if ($input- getOption('yell')) {\n            $text = strtoupper($text);\n        }\n\n        $output- writeln($text);\n    }\n}  This command will now automatically be available to run:      $ ./backbee demo:welcome Charles",
