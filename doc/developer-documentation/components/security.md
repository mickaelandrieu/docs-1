# Components

## The Security Component

`BackBee` Security component is based on the Security Component of `Symfony`.

It provides a robust way to secure a web application. Here we will present some of the core concepts of this component : `firewall`, `FirewallMap`, `authentication` , `authorization`, `DecissionAccess`,  `Voter`, `SecurityContext`.

## Overview of security mechanism

The main purpose of the security component is to deal with *authentication* and *authorization*.

Authentication is a way to grant access to a ressource. When a user is successfully authentified, authorization is a way to control access to a specific ressource.

Authentication is handled by what is called a *firewall*. An application can have many secured areas, an admin area for instance.

A secured area is determined by an *url*. When an url that is part of a secured area is requested, behind the hook some registered callbacks are executed.

The `Firewall` archives this by listening to the `symfony` `kernel.request` event triggered by the HttpKernel.
A `FirewallMap` maps a `request` with the registered listeners then checks if the current request is under a secured area or is already secured.

A `FirewallMap` Listener can authenticate a request, throws an `AuthenticationException` or do nothing. If one of these listeners throw an exception (meaning that the request is not authentificated), this exception can either be transformed into an `AccessDeniedHttpException` or used to initiate an authentication process by calling the `Firewall` entry point.

## Authentication

A firewall entry point, as it implements the `authenticationEntryPointInterface`, must provided a `start` method which takes two parameters: a request and the exception previously raised.

`start` must return a `Response` object that can be a page showing a form for instance.
If one of the `FirewallMap` Listener can handle the request, it creates a `Token` object that holds a reference to the current user, its roles and its credentials.
The listener then uses an `authenticationProviderManager` object to authenticate the `Token`. `authenticationProviderManager` will authenticate the token if provided and return an *authenticated* one if the user credential is valid.

Otherwise an `AuthenticationException` is raised.
Each *Token* uses a specific type of *authenticationProvider*. An *authenticationProvider* must implements the `authenticationProviderInterface` and provides the two methods :  `authentificate` which takes one paramater that must implements the `TokenInterface` and `supports` which is used to check whether or not the given `token` is supported by the authentication provider .

Registered FirewallMap Listeners must implement the `ListenerInterface` thus provided an `handle` method that accept an `GetRequestEvent` object.

## Authorization

Once a user is identified his roles or any other attributes or object of its `token` can be used to determine whether or not he has access to a resource.

### Decision manager

 An `AccessControlManager` is used to make final access decisions based on `Voter`.

 A voter can decide to `vote` either for grant or deny access to a ressource. A voter can also abstain itself.

 By default The `AccessControllerManagers` make his decision according to one these three strategies:

 * **affirmative** (Access is granted if any voter votes for granting access)
 * **consensus** (Access is granted if there are more voters willing to granting access then otherwise
 * **unanimous** (Access is granted if all voters vote for granting access)


#### Understand voters

A voter class must implements the `VoterInterface` which has 4 methods:

*  **supportsAttribute($attribute)**
*  **supportsClass($class)**
*  **vote(TokentInterface $token, $object, $attributes)**

`supportsAttribute` is used to check if the voter supports some attributes of the token.
`supportClass` is user to check it the voter supports a specific class
`vote` handle the vote strategy and must return of those class Constant :

 - VoterInterface::ACCESS_GRANTED
 - VoterInterface::ACCESS_ABSTAIN
 - VoterInterface::ACCESS_DENIED

Bellow is list of Voter used in BackBee
* AccessVoter
* BBAclVoter
* BBRoleVoter
* SudoVoter

## BackBee SecurityContext and the ContextInterface

All the process of creating `Firewall`, `FirewallMap`, `AuthenticationManager`, `AccessDecisionMananger` and listeners is handled by the `BackBee\Security\SecurityContext` object.

However the way of dealing with security Listerners is simplyfied by using a `Context` object.
A security `Context` extends the abstract class `BackBee\Security\Context\BBAuthContext` and defines the **loadListeners** method.

`LoadListeners` accepts one parameter which is the security config that can be setted in `repository/Config/security.yml`.
A context can be used to instanciate new listener or to register new authentication provider to the `SecuriryContext`.

Bellow we show all the  security contexts provided by BackBee.

* AnonymousContext
* BBAuthContext
* LogoutContext
* RestfulContext
* StatelessContext
* UsernamePasswordContext

#### AnonymousContext

`AnonymouseContext` is used to identify anonymous user.

* **authentication provider** : `BackBee\Security\Authentication\Provider\AnonymousAuthenticationProvider`
* **Listener**: `BackBee\Security\Listeners\AnonymousAuthenticationListener`
* **Token** : `BackBee\Security\Token\AnonymousToken`


#### BBAuthContext

`BBAuthContext` is used to authentify a user by using the BackBee User table.

* **authentication provider** : `BackBee\Security\Authentication\Provider\BBAuthenticationProvider`
* **Listener**: `BackBee\Security\Listeners\AnonymousAuthenticationListener`
* **Token** : `BackBee\Security\Token\BBUserToken`

#### LogoutContext

`LogoutContext` handles user logout by removing all setted tokens.

* **authentication provider** : `none`
* **Token** : `none`
* **Listener**: `BackBee\Security\Listeners\LogoutListener`

#### RestfulContext

`RestfulContext` is used to authentify rest user with a plublic key.

* **authentication provider**: `BackBee\Security\Listeners\PublicKeyAuthenticationProvider`
* **Listener** : `BackBee\Security\Listeners\PublicKeyAuthenticationListener`
* **Token**: `BackBee\Security\Token\BBUserToken`

#### StatelessContext

In stateless mode, authentication is asked for every requests. `StatelessContext` handles sessions
creation every time stateless mode is disabled.

* **authentication provider**: `none`
* **Listener**: `BackBee\Security\Listeners\ContextListener`
* **Token**: `none`

#### UsernamePasswordContext

`UsernamePasswordContext`is used to authenticate user by using a login form.

* **authentication provider**: `BackBee\Security\Listeners\Provider\UserAuthenticationProvider`
* **Listener**: `BackBee\Security\Listeners\UsernamePasswordAuthenticationListener`
* **Token**: `BackBee\Security\Token\UsernamePasswordToken`

## Configuring Security with `security.yml`

Security configurations can be handled with a simple yml file. This file can be found in ``repository/Config/security.yml``.

```yaml
firewalls:
    bb_area:
        pattern: ^/
        requirements:
            HTTP-X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
            HTTP-X-BB-METHOD: (JsonRpc|Upload)
        provider: bb_user
        bb_auth:
            provider: bb_user
            nonce_dir: security/nonces
            lifetime: 1800
            use_registry: true

providers:
    bb_user:
        entity:
            class: BackBee\Security\User
        secret: %secret_key%
    public_key:
        entity:
            class: BackBee\Security\User

contexts:
    BackBee\Security\Context: [StatelessContext, AnonymousContext, BBAuthContext, UsernamePasswordContext, LogoutContext, RestfulContext]

encoders:
    BackBee\Security\User:
        class: Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Encoder\MessageDigestPasswordEncoder
        arguments:
            algorithm: md5
            encode_as_base64: false
            iterations: 1

acl:
    connection: default
```
